## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

There are many great calendar apps and tools, but I didn't find one that could fits all of my needs, so because I have no hobbies anyways I am now on my journey to create my own calendar with smart features such as:

* Automated event scheduling (coming soon) 
* Natural language processing (NLP) (also coming soon)
* cli calendar management including creating, deleting and editing tasks

## Built With
